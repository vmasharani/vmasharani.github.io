    <h2>Institutional Decay: MICA and Neoliberalism <a href="#" id="scrollup">Top</a></h2>
    <div id="trigger"></div>

    <h3><span class="number">1.</span> Context</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
       MICA becomes corporate because the administration accepts neoliberalism as the fundamental organizing principle for the institution.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In other words, MICA makes decisions not based on what is best for the student body, but based on what will allow for the accumulation and proliferation of capital. MICA directly or indirectly seeks to define students not in terms of their humanity but in terms of a market.

    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
       This shift from a community-oriented institution to capital-centered one has consequences in the school’s curriculum, its fees, its treatment of its students and its treatment of its faculty.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      The school creates a closed system in which tuition hikes yield a greater demand for a return on investment. The school argues that this return on investment requires new programs, which justify tuition hikes.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      The programs that are implemented are vocational by necessity. They are also ideological poison to the students because, while their implementation increasingly saddles the students with debt, they also undermine the ability for dissent against this kind of structural change. <span class="emph1">If you find yourself stricken by financial hardship following graduation, it becomes “your fault” as opposed to the institution's—you should have innovated harder.</span>
    </p>

    <h3><span class="number">2.</span> Demography</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      There are, in general, two kinds of students that will accept a $50k/year arts education.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      First, there are the kids who can afford it—the children of doctors, lawyers, business executives, engineers, and tech workers. These students are largely privileged such that they can live relatively apolitically. This is less true when we consider racial and gender identity—for instance, wealthy PoC still feel the sting of racism. Ultimately, however, wealth does allow for a mobility that renders structural constraints less perceptible. Poor kids know these limits in a very real way.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      The other category includes those who want to be artists more than anything and will bury themselves in debt to do so. These students get the shortest end of the stick. <span class="emph2">Capital requires systemization and homogenization; risk-taking and experimentation—two essential elements to creative growth—are actually antithetical to the behaviors of capital.</span> This becomes increasingly oppressive as professors implore students not to push their practice, but to find their niche and conceive of themselves in terms of the desires of the market. MICA artists identify themselves not with a radical transgressive practice but with a highly atomized status quo. <span class="emph1">These students would, based on experience, arguably be the best equipped to critique the institution.</span> However, the constant imperative to make some of the money back makes it more difficult to engage in critical reflection insofar as critique is a luxury—it does not mobilize into wealth very well at all.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      I recently spoke to a sophomore sculpture major that I had an academic with last semester; he’s a middle-class dude from a small town outside of Philadelphia. He’s transferring out of MICA because the tuition is too high. He was one of three people in the class able to offer coherent critiques of local legislature, academia, and capitalism. I don’t know that MICA, in its current state, feels that loss with the same gravity that I do.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      <span class="emph2">The fact that he’s leaving troubles me because it epitomizes how MICA’s neoliberal turn consists of indirect ideological cleansing.</span> Students who are from circumstances that allow them to critique MICA’s harmful exploitative economic practices from actual experience <span class="emph1">can no longer afford to even be in the room.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Those that remain at MICA tend to critique from a theoretical position like my own, which lacks a certain urgency. I will make no effort to conceal that I come from distinct privilege and that my ability to conduct this kind of critique is itself a product of that privilege.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Even more troubling is what happens when students <span class="emph1">cannott</span> pay. In a particularly egregious case, MICA recently threatened to transfer the debt of a former student, an undocumented immigrant directly threatened by Trump’s executive orders to a collector that will then pursue legal action if he continues to be unable to pay. He already works three jobs—entering data, as a waiter, and as a deliveryman. MICA can't take the heat of bankrupting this student themselves, so they are absolving themselves of responsibility through this transfer.
    </p>

    <h3><span class="number">3.</span> Curricular Consequences</h3>


    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Needless to say, these institutional conditions are immensely problematic when trying to make good art. The networked, regimented, vocational atmosphere that capital requires has stultifying consequences on students' work. Students who came here with an ineffable, even spiritual drive to create are forced to reconceive themselves in the terms of weekly critiques, professional development seminars, start-up competitions, and unpaid internships. Thus, we see how MICA’s mediocrity and its administrative decisions are linked.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Different departments are pressured to synthesize with the demands of capital.<span class="emph2">They do not foster artists equipped to understand, describe, and deal with the urgent issues of our time: climate change, the rise of antidemocratic ethno-Nationalism, police violence, all of which can be said to be sustained and accelerated by capitalism.</span>

    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
       A department like graphic design is obviously quite well equipped for this pivot. What is ommitted by the graphic design department is any sort of ethical framework for design. There’s a lot of <span class="emph1">"how"</span> with very little <span class="emph1">"why"</span> and almost no <span class="emph1">"towards what ends</span>?". This is problematic because students will go on to, essentially, have careers that consist of providing redemptive branding for exploitative  corporations whose main victims are PoC women in developing countries. These students will oftentimes do so without any awareness of their own culpability—on the contrary, they will be celebrated by the institution for the legibility of their success.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In a class discussion I had in GD4, one student, quite a good designer I might add, went as far as to assert that he would see no problem with rebranding a white supremacist group—he regarded design as an impartial activity whose only moral duty is to adhere to the will of the client.  The class balked at his assertion; however I don’t blame him—<span class="emph1">his argument was the logical conclusion of everything he had been taught up until that point.</span> Don't think—just work.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Social design programs are an ineffective solution—they are, essentially, a deprecated form of social justice  that refuses to actually challenge the economic and ideological status quo. Social design practices are white saviorism for the new millenium—<span class="emph2">black and brown children squatting with glitsy laptops gifted to them by college students operate as absolution for the guilt of gentrification.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Departments such as GFA, Painting, and Drawing, when faced with the criteria of the market, embrace its limited aesthetic sensibilities (abstraction, bright colors, medium scale) when they can. They do not name capital, but subtly instill its taste in their students. <span class="emph2">The “MICA aesthetic” is nothing but what the market really liked about 10 years ago mixed with self-indulgent deskilling under the guise of "self expression" and a dash of design envy.</span> More often than not, however, these departments simply embrace their own obsolescence. Capital does not have a use for fine art other than as a stable investment for an ultra-rich asset class. The impotence and the intellectual bankruptcy of the GFA/Painting/Drawing departments can thus be understood as a tacit acceptance of capitalist logic.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      It is difficult for me to succinctly describe the issues within these departments; I would recommend talking to any women or PoC in those departments for specific accounts of the rampant misogyny, racism, and overall contempt towards students’ experiences, interests, and material circumstances on the part of the faculty. This is not true for every professor, but is especially true among thesis and junior independent professors.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Professors are as incapable of discussing the political dimension of artistic practice as they are of analyzing their own behaviors. They stick to banal formal observations and are either dismissive or hostile to alternative approaches that might try to challenge the status-quo. Some professors, who express a desire to be political, anonymously report to me that <span class="emph1">they have been explicitly instructed <span class="emph2">not</span> to be political by department heads.</span>
    </p>


    <p class="articleparagraph">
      This push towards the apolitical is again, not accidental. Political conversations are risky for the classroom—there is a chance that a critical eye might be turned towards the academy itself.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Within the liberal arts department, courses that offer overt critiques of capital have to fight to stay in the curriculum. They threaten the integrity of #MICAmade, <span class="emph2">which itself is an anthem to the erosion of artistic integrity by market forces.</span> I have been told that some professors tacitly work critiques of capital into other topics in order to dodge skepticism from the administration.
    </p>



    <h3><span class="number">4.</span> Psychological Consequences</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      <span class="emph1">Just as the consequences of neoliberal logic are felt within the curriculum, they are also felt within the overall psychological condition of the student body.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Corporate logic is individualizing—this is actually, interestingly enough, part of the logic of capital that coheres nicely with the hypermasculine solo-genius trope that is still perpetuated by the painting department. The strict regimentation of coursework ultimately disallows collaboration. Under the logic of capital, students feel overworked and underaccomplished. The distinct lack of artist’s collectives at MICA has structural origins; potential for interesting collaboration tends to dissolve into small individual conflicts.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Additionally, the individualizing logic of capital erodes the capacity for empathy, thereby compromising critique. Critique becomes a chore, students feel disconnected from their peers, their professors, and most tragically, themselves. This is not because they’re actually that antipathetic, but because that is the kind of classroom atmosphere the school actively decides to instill. In other instances, students who are working one to three jobs don’t have ample time to actually make work for the critiques and show up overwhelmed, disappointed, and confused.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      This has consequences in the actual quality of the work—artists are, in general, sustained by community; at MICA, we are forced to make it solipsistically, using only the criteria of capital. There is a recursive formula here; disillusionment tends to yield more disillusionment since nobody seems to be making the work they really want to make. <span class="emph1">The studio center is empty during the week and to attempt to understand why requires institutional critique.</span>
    </p>

    <h3><span class="number">5.</span> Where to from here?</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      By contrasting the Graphic Design department’s response to MICA’s corporate turn with the response given by Painting/GFA/Drawing, we see two different paths to mediocrity. Design without a critical underpinning becomes either purely formal semantics (and thus completely devoid of revolutionary potential) or, in many cases, complicit in institutional oppression of large groups of people. These groups are invisible to MICA students—as I've described, high tuition is implicitly exclusively; furthermore, the key victims of design-as-terrorism are located in developing countries. <span class="emph2">Refer to, for instance, how designers helped obfuscate private security contractor Blackwater's role in the Nisour Square massacre or the relationship between fashion companies and the 2013 Savar building collapse.</span> On the other hand, fine art without an awareness of its political context or its grounding within the material world can only be regressive decoration at best.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In a sense, MICA is not wrong to recognize that under the conditions of late-capitalism, power is increasingly concentrated in certain fields. <span class="emph1">Those fields are not AbEx oil painting or found object sculpture. They are, as MICA has correctly identified, largely in tech and finance. Thus, these fields receiving more emphasis is not an inherently bad thing. I'm of the opinion that we should be compelling artists to gain these skillsets and then mobilize them for emancipatory ends.</span> However, this technocratic pivot as it stands, when combined with economic exploitation and a deliberate erosion of the capacity for productive critique, produces nothing but dilute corporate work that students cannot find enjoyment or meaning in. Great work is still made at MICA. However, this happens against the grain of the institution—the best artists at MICA regard MICA as an institution—not necessarily the individual people within it—as impeding their artistic progress, not supporting it.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In order to become a holistic arts institution for the contemporary political epoch, MICA needs to go a third way. It should, as it has, bring the grammar of neoliberalism into the classroom. However, it should be included not as an organizing principle, but as a topic of interdisciplinary critique—critique that can be written, but should also be sculptural, performative, subversive, and collaborative.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      MICA’s project as of now is to synthesize artistic practice with the structures of capital. It should recognize that these fields are incongruous—when this synthesis does occur, it produces nothing but glitsy mediocrity. This synthesis is untenable because the vision of futurity that artists seek to depict and actively pursue—a vision that is egalitarian, multicultural, sustainable, and empathetic—is the opposite of the vision of futurity provided by capital. Thus, MICA’s endeavor will be unsuccessful and even self-destructive unless they take immediate action towards de-centering capital, pursuing socio-economic diversity, decreasing tuition, ending the exploitation of adjunct professors, and recognizing that the arts are exceptional not for their entrepreneurial potential but for their sheer humanity. Students should not be so complacent—they should feel the courage to tell the institution through whatever avenues they can find that this path is the wrong path. Not only is there a political urgency here, but there is a question of potential; great artists are stifled at MICA. We should be attempting to foster a culture that allows them to flourish.
