    <h2>Institutional Decay: MICA and Neoliberalism <a href="#" id="scrollup">Top</a></h2>
    <div id="trigger"></div>

    <h3><span class="number">1.</span> Context</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
       MICA becomes corporate because the administration accepts neoliberalism as the key organizational principle of the institution.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In other words, MICA makes decisions not based on what is best for the student body, but based on what will allow for the accumulation and proliferation of capital.

    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
       This shift from a community-oriented institution to capital-centered one has consequences in the school’s curriculum, its fees, and its treatment of its students and its faculty.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      The school creates a sort of closed system in which tuition hikes yield a greater demand for a return on investment. The school argues that this return on investment requires new programs, which justify tuition hikes.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      The programs that are implemented are vocational by necessity. They are also ideological poison to the students because, while their implementation increasingly saddles the students with debt, it undermines the ability for dissent against this kind of structural change. <span class="emph1">If you find yourself stricken by financial hardship following graduation, it becomes “your fault” as opposed to the institutions’—you should have innovated harder.</span>
    </p>

    <h3><span class="number">2.</span> Demography</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      There are, in general, two kinds of students that will accept a $50k/year arts education.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      First, there are the kids who can afford it—the children of doctors, lawyers, business executives, engineers, and figures in tech. These students are largely privileged such that they can live relatively apolitically. This is less true with respect to identity—for instance, wealthy PoC still feel the sting of racism, but wealth does allow for class mobility that renders institutional limits invisible and immaterial. Poor kids know those limits in a very real way.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      The other category includes those who want to be artists more than anything and will bury themselves in debt to do so. These students get the shortest end of the stick. <span class="emph2">Capital requires systemization; risk-taking and experimentation—two essential elements to creative growth—are actually antithetical to the behaviors of capital.</span>This becomes increasingly oppressive as professors implore students not to push their practice, but to find their niche and conceive of themselves in terms of the desires of the market. <span class="emph1">Additionally, these students are arguably the best equipped to critique the institution.</span> However, the constant imperative to make some of their money back makes it more difficult to engage in critical reflection.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      I recently spoke to a sophomore sculpture major that I had an academic with last semester; he’s a middle-class dude from a small town outside of Philly. He’s transferring out of MICA because the tuition is too much. He was one of three people in the class able to offer coherent critiques of local legislature, academia, and capitalism. I don’t know that MICA, in its current state, feels that loss with the same gravity that I do.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      <span class="emph2">The fact that he’s leaving troubled me because it epitomizes how MICA’s neoliberal turn consists of indirect ideological cleansing.</span> Students who are from circumstances that allow them to critique MICA’s harmful exploitative economic practices from the point of view of actual experience can no longer afford to be in the room.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Those that remain can critique only from a theoretical position like mine, which lacks a certain urgency. I will make no effort to conceal that I come from distinct privilege and that my ability to conduct this kind of critique is itself a product of that privilege.
    </p>



    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Even more troubling is what happens when students can’t pay. In a particularly egregious case, MICA recently threatened to transfer the debt of a former student, an undocumented immigrant directly threatened by Trump’s executive orders on immigration, to a collector that will then pursue legal action if he continues to be unable to pay. He already works three jobs—entering data, as a waiter, and as a deliveryman. MICA can't take the heat of bankrupting this student themselves, so they are absolving themselves of responsibility through this transfer.
    </p>

        <h3><span class="number">3.</span> Curricular Consequences</h3>


    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Needless to say, these institutional conditions are problematic when trying to make great art. MICA’s mediocrity and its administrative decisions are linked.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Different departments are pressured to synthesize with the demands of capital.<span class="emph2">They do not foster artists equipped to understand, describe, and deal with the urgent issues of our time: climate change, the rise of antidemocratic ethno-Nationalism, police violence, all of which can be said to be sustained and accelerated by capitalism.</span>

    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
       A department like Graphic Design is obviously, well equipped for this pivot. What is ommitted by the graphic design department is any sort of ethical framework for design. There’s a lot of <span class="emph1">how</span> with very little <span class="emph1">why</span> and almost no <span class="emph1">towards what ends</span>? This is problematic because students will go on to, essentially, have careers that consist of providing an endearing veneer to the exploitative international terrorism of large corporations, whose main victims are  PoC women in developing countries, without any awareness of their own culpability.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In a class discussion I had in GD4, one student, quite a good designer I might add, went as far as to assert that he would see no problem in rebranding a white supremacist group—he regarded design as an impartial activity whose only moral dictum is to adhere to the will of the client. The class balked at his assertion; however I don’t blame him <span class="emph1">his argument was the logical conclusion of everything he had been taught up until that point.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Social design programs are an ineffective solution—they are, essentially, a deprecated form of social justice activism that refuses to actually challenge the economic and ideological status quo of capitalism. Social design practices are white saviorism for the new millenium—<span class="emph2">black and brown children squatting with glitsy laptops gifted to them by college students operate as ideological absolution for the guilt of gentrification.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Departments such as GFA, Painting, and Drawing, when faced with the criteria of the market, embrace its limited aesthetic sensibilities (abstraction, bright colors, medium scale) when they can. They do not name capital, but subtly instill its taste in their students. <span class="emph2">The “MICA aesthetic” is nothing but what the market really liked about 10 years ago mixed with self-indulgent deskilling under the guise of "self expression" and a dash of design envy.</span> More often than not, however, these departments simply embrace their own obsolescence.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      It is difficult for me to succinctly describe the intellectual bankruptcy in these departments; I would recommend talking to any women or PoC in those departments for specific accounts of the rampant misogyny, racism, and overall contempt towards students’ experiences, interests, and material circumstances on the part of the faculty.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Professors are as incapable of discussing the political dimension of artistic practice as they are of analyzing their own behaviors.They stick to banal formal observations and are either dismissive or hostile to alternative approaches. Other professors, who express a desire to be political, anonymously report to me that <span class="emph1">they have been explicitly instructed not to be political by department heads.</span>
    </p>


    <p class="articleparagraph">
      This push towards the apolitical is again, not accidental. Political conversations are risky for the classroom—there is a chance that a critical eye might be turned towards the academy itself.

    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Professional Practices, the required “professional development course” for GFA/Painting/Drawing is a synthesis of the department's ineptitude with neoliberal logic. In it, we learn what a “professional practice” for a painter or a sculptor looks like—apparently, according to guest lecturer Amy Sherald, cultivating a collector base, “branding oneself,” and then machinically cranking out paintings in a kind of death-ritual of the artistic spirit itself.

    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Within the liberal arts department, courses that offer overt critiques of capital have to fight to stay in the curriculum—again, they threaten the integrity of #MICAmade, <span class="emph2">which itself is an anthem to the erosion of artistic integrity by market forces.</span> I have been told that some professors tacitly work critiques of capital into other topics in order to dodge skepticism from the administration.
    </p>



    <h3><span class="number">4.</span> Psychological Consequences</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      <span class="emph1">Just as the consequences of neoliberal logic are felt within the curriculum, they are also felt within the overall psychological condition of the student body.</span>
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Corporate logic is individualizing—this is actually, interestingly enough, part of the logic of capital that coheres nicely with the hypermasculine solo-genius trope that is still perpetuated by the painting department. The strict regimentation of coursework and the constant tide of progress checks, group critiques, and lectures ultimately disallows collaboration. The distinct lack of artist’s collectives at MICA has structural origins; potential for interesting collaboration tends to dissolve into small individual conflicts.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      Additionally, the individualizing logic of capital erodes the capacity for empathy, thereby compromising critique. Critique becomes a chore, students feel disconnected from their peers and their professors not because they’re actually that antipathetic, but because that is the kind of classroom atmosphere the school actively decides to instill. In other instances, students who are working 1–3 jobs don’t have ample time to actually make work for the critiques and show up overwhelmed, disappointed, and confused.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      This has consequences in the actual quality of the work—artists are, in general, sustained by community; at MICA, we are forced to make it solipsistically, using only the criteria of capital. There is a recursive formula here; disillusionment tends to yield more disillusionment since nobody seems to be making the work they really want to make. <span class="emph1">The studio center is empty during the week and to attempt to understand why requires institutional critique.</span>
    </p>

    <h3><span class="number">5.</span> Where to from here?</h3>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      By contrasting the Graphic Design department’s response to MICA’s corporate turn with the response given by Painting/GFA/Drawing, we see two different paths to mediocrity. Design without a critical underpinning becomes either purely formal semantics (and thus completely devoid of revolutionary potential) or, in many cases, complicit in institutional oppression of large groups of people. <span class="emph2">Refer to, for instance, how designers helped obfuscate private security contractor Blackwater's role in the Nisour Square massacre or the relationship between fashion companies and the 2013 Savar building collapse.</span> On the other hand, Fine art without an awareness of its political context or its grounding within the material world is regressive decoration at best.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In a sense, MICA is not wrong to recognize that under the conditions of late-capitalism, power is increasingly concentrated in certain fields. <span class="emph1">Those fields are not AbEx oil painting or found object sculpture. They are, as MICA has correctly identified, largely in tech and finance. Thus, these fields receiving more emphasis is not an inherently bad thing.</span> However, that technological pivot, when combined with economic exploitation and a deliberate erosion of the capacity for productive critique, will ultimately be a self-destructive gesture. Great work is still made at MICA. However, it is in spite of the institution, not because of it.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      In order to become a holistic arts institution for the contemporary epoch, MICA needs to go a third way. It should, as it has, bring the grammar of neoliberalism into the classroom. However, it should be included not as an organizing principle, but as a topic of interdisciplinary critique—critique that can be written, as this piece is, but should also be sculptural, performative, subversive, and collaborative.
    </p>

    <p class="articleparagraph">
      MICA’s project as of now is to synthesize artistic practice with the structures of capital. This is untenable because the vision of futurity that artists seek to depict and actively pursue—a vision that is egalitarian, multicultural, sustainable, and empathetic—is the opposite of the vision of futurity provided by capital. Thus, MICA’s endeavor to become MICAD will be unsuccessful and even self-destructive unless they take immediate action towards de-centering capital, bringing in socio-economic diversity, decreasing tuition, ending the exploitation of adjunct professors, and recognizing that the arts are exceptional not for their entrepreneurial potential but for their sheer humanity.
