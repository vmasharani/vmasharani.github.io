  <p class="description">Crimes based on gender and gender identity have been consolidated into one category—gender. Changes were made to the data that also resulted in some ommissions. Most notably, when the data referred to a police department, a college campus, or a metropolitan county that could not be geocoded, it does not get included in the statistics. I regret that I was not able to include these crimes with the immediate means—in future iterations, I would like to manipulate the data further so that I can include these non-city based statistics in a meaningful manner.</p>

  <p class="description">The FBI data was presented only in an .xls format. I reformatted it using an online JSON converter. Longitude/latitude data comes from a downloaded array, since I kept hitting my query limit for the Google API.</p>
