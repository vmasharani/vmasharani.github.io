I am determined to find them about as threatening as a canary; although that doesn’t make their presence or influence any less violent, especially when intimately acquainted. They add themselves to a long list of goals, curiosities, and parliamentary procedures—a bureaucratic gesture that yields an externally emergent lust as opposed to an authentic desire.

Who teaches young brown boys how to love? Who to love? When brownness is constructed in terms of technical (or service/hospitality) labor, love is lost among duty. (I’m anti-work.)

She, over the years, had little interest in how colorful folks came to America and were subsequently caned, whipped, caged by this country. She wasn’t doubtful, she was just bored. She was drawn to a more orthodox history of America, in which sand people were defined in terms of the Frank Sinatra types that they flirted with.

In this vision, pastors feigned outrage as actual counterculture surrendered itself to a pernicious religion that was more dangerous than before because this new form was no longer bound to the Bible. We were among the casualties of this New Atomized Religion.

The next generation of these amoebic brown folk drafted a coordinated fiasco in spraycan and in bic pen in the margins of lecture notes. They colored outside the lines; neither people nor their parents, white or black, could see each other in this gorgeous trainwreck. Thrust into severe, immediate contact in hip boroughs, internet forums, and Benneton ad campaigns, parties constantly got under each others’ skins and realized each others’ sins—both original and contemporaneous.

We chose to arise from our laborious slumber. We chose to grow fins and gills and to swim back into the ocean. People were surprised—they thought we gave a shit that we were in this country in the first place. White faces attempted to supercede color lines by staging an insurrection via deprecated identity politics. They repressed their desires through therapies and thanatropic nightlife.

We are nightmares for the aging racist. We have torn down the gates of what to do and what can be done while we defiantly shut down any conversation about what could or should be done with us. We speak with the sophistication of seeds and trees, of Baghdad and Fremont, never conflating any shade of brown, red, blue, or grey, but thriving in their irreducibility. How happy it makes us to disparage our new impermanent non-home. To never be grateful. To score the earth that belongs to nobody with pithy, defiant tales of our own agency.
